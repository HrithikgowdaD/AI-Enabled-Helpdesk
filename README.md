🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip package manager
Virtual environment (recommended)
Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Akash4908/UPI-Fraud-Detection.git
cd upi_fraud_detection
Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables (optional)

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
Running the Application
First Run (Model Training)
python app.py
On the first run, the system will:

Load and preprocess the UPI dataset
Generate synthetic fraud data using GAN
Train XGBoost and Random Forest models
Build user anomaly detection models
Create the SQLite database
This may take 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware.

Subsequent Runs
python app.py
Subsequent runs will load pre-trained models and start the Flask server immediately.

For Production
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

🐛 Troubleshooting
Models Not Loading
ERROR: 'models/xgb_model.pkl' not found
Solution: Run python app.py once to train models. This is a one-time setup.

Database Locked
ERROR: database is locked
Solution: Ensure only one instance of the app is running. Delete fraud_detection.db to reset.

Import Errors
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'
Solution: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies.

Phishing Model Missing
WARNING: 'phishing_feature.py' not found. Phishing detector will be disabled.
Solution: Phishing detection is optional. Train it separately with PhishingDetection.py.

📊 Model Performance
XGBoost Metrics (typical)
Accuracy: ~95%
Precision: ~93%
Recall: ~92%
F1-Score: ~92%
AUC-ROC: ~0.98
(Actual performance depends on dataset and training parameters)

🔄 Retraining Models
To retrain models with new data:

# In Python shell
from model_training import train_models
from preprocess import preprocess_pipeline

df, encoders = preprocess_pipeline()
rf_model, xgb_model = train_models(df)

# Save models
import pickle
with open('models/xgb_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(xgb_model, f)
